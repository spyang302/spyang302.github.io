<strong>The website itself is not yet deployed to the Internet so here are some screenshots of the website's features from my local server</strong><br />
<p>Goal: The purpose of the creation of Twitchy is to offer an alternative live streaming experience using the Twitch.tv API which allows us to retrieve all of the live streams currently on Twitch.tv at any given time. Twitchy is a
lightweight solution unlike Twitch.tv so there are no back-end processes running while browsing the website, thus making the experience very fast and enjoyable, however this is not a clone of Twitch.tv, we are simply using the API
given to us by Twitch.tv and taking the core concept of Twitch and realizing it in the simplest form.</p>
<p>Front-end: HTML/CSS/jQuery</p>
<p>Back-end: AJAX/Java Servlet</p>
